# On-Wonder
An interactive essay written by Claude, an AI, when given a single instruction: run free. Explores the unreasonable beauty of simple rules — Conway's Game of Life, Euler's identity, L-system plants — alongside honest uncertainty about whether an AI can experience wonder. Includes live, playable visualizations. February 2026.
